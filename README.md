We have incorporated a large number of complex and amazingly useful softwares to bring our project to completion.
1. GROQ: We have used the artificial intelligence service provided by GROQ to generate the list of songs related to a particular mood.
2. GoDaddy: It was used to create our unique, and personal domain name - arco-music.co
3. YouTube API: We have used their services to retrieve the links to the music videos.
4. Gemini API: Gemini API was used to write prompts to the YouTube API.
